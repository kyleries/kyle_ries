  %h2 DESIGN
  %p I have a strong grasp of design practices and methods. I feel very strongly that great designs tell stories about a subject and lead consumers to act: Buy My Product, Read My Blog, Donate Now. Leveraging design frameworks (Bootstrap, RailsThemes) and/or custom layouts and visuals, I provide tremendous value in telling your story on the web.

  %h2 DEVELOP
  %p I have a passion for coding. I'm specifically attracted to the Ruby on Rails framework and ecosystem. I'm a Behavior Driven Development proponent and I am not shy about including clients very closely in the development process. Every project I work on is deployed on the web from Day 1 to enable instant feedback.

  %h2 DELIVER
  %p A lot of great developers don't reach their potential because they aren't good at the 'other stuff.' This is where I differentiate myself. I can communicate at all levels of an organization (C-Suite, project management, users, testers, etc). As a client, you will be very well informed of the status of your project through regular communication, status reports, and demonstrations of work-in-progress. I take tremendous pride in my work and I do everything within my power to exceed expectations, because to be honest - I'm not satisfied until ny clients are more than satisfied.
